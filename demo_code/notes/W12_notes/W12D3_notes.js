/*

Security

CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    Allows other apps to send requests to our API
    Enforced by the browser
    CORS policies are just middleware

XSS attack - Cross Site Scripting
    Being able to inject code into someone else's website

CSRF attack
    When someone creates their own requests and tricks another user into sending that request

Pretty common for XSS and CSRF attacks to happen together
